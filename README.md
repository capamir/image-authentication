Image Authentication and Blockchain Storage Platform
This platform provides a secure way to store, verify, and restore images using encryption, blockchain technology, and advanced image processing methods such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

Features

Image Storage:
Clients upload their images to the platform.
The platform encrypts the image using secure functions and processes the image using DCT for efficient storage and retrieval.
The encrypted image and processed data are saved in a blockchain for secure and tamper-proof storage.

Image Authentication:
A client submits an image to verify its authenticity.
The platform decrypts and compares the image data using the stored DCT and other processing methods.
It confirms whether the image is authentic and restores the original, if verified.

How It Works:

Image Storage
The client uploads an image.
The platform performs:
DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform): Converts the image into a frequency domain representation for better compression and analysis.
Encryption: Secures the image data.
Blockchain Storage: Saves the encrypted image and DCT data in a tamper-proof ledger.


Image Authentication
A client submits an image for verification.

The platform performs:
Decryption: Retrieves the stored image data.
DCT Analysis: Compares the frequency-domain data of the submitted image with the stored data.
Verification: Confirms the authenticity of the image.
Restoration: Restores the image if it matches.


Technologies Used
Encryption/Decryption: For secure image storage and retrieval.
DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform): To analyze and process image data efficiently.
Blockchain: For secure and tamper-proof storage.
Client-Server Architecture: For efficient communication and processing.


Installation
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:
npm install
...
Set up the blockchain environment and configure the encryption keys.


Usage

Upload an Image: Clients can upload an image to be securely stored on the blockchain.
Verify an Image: Submit an image to check its authenticity and retrieve the original, if valid.
